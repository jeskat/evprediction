not include hybrid electric vehicles. Grant amounts range from
$2,000 to $50,000 and are determined according to the following
formulas:

* For the purchase of OEM AFVs for which the manufacturer
produces a conventionally fueled equivalent, 80% of the
incremental cost is eligible for funding.
* For the purchase of OEM AFVs for which the manufacturer does
not produce a conventionally fueled equivalent, 30% of the
overall cost of the vehicle is eligible for funding.
* For the conversion of vehicles to run on an alternative fuel,
80% of the cost of conversion is eligible for funding.
* For the purchase and installation of refueling facilities for
an alternative fuel to be used in vehicles, 50% of the facility
cost is eligible for funding.
* For the purchase and use of E85 or biodiesel in blends of 20%
or higher, 50% of the incremental cost is eligible for funding.

Project budgets may include funding from third party sources, but
the applicant itself must directly contribute at least 20% of the
project's total budget. If a grant is awarded, the applicant
will receive funds on a reimbursement basis only. Businesses,
non-profit institutions and units of local government (including

    and development of public charging infrastructure;
-   The impact of PEVs on grid stability and the integration of
    renewable energy resources;
-   The technological advances necessary to ensure the widespread use of
    PEVs and what role the state should take to support the development
    of this technology;
-   The existing code and permit requirements that will impact the
    widespread use of PEVs and any recommended changes to existing
    policies that may be barriers to the widespread use of PEVs;
